# What's Xscribe?

Shorthand that borrows kanji (Chinese characters) or glyphs without linguistic accuracy. The main purpose is to take the shape and meaning of the characters to reinforce a concept. This shorthand system doesn't obey Japanese grammatical rules for sentence structure. Kanji serves as an anchor for semantic domains (e.g. InfoSec, perspective drawing, etc.) 

🌍 Origin

The idea grew from my background in translation and interpretation, and especially from my fascination with simultaneous interpreting—that mental dance of keeping the brain’s processor and the hand’s motion perfectly in sync.
Writing shorthand became a way to train that same split-second coordination: decoding complex ideas while encoding them back into symbols that fit the page, the moment, and my memory.

Xscribe’s goal is to bring that experience into a digital space—helping learners, creators, and technologists translate dense material into shorthand-friendly, visually meaningful notes.

🧩 How It Works

Lexicon Files (YAML): Each domain (Security+, IT, Art, Legal, etc.) has its own dictionary of terms and their shorthand equivalents.

Core Engine: A lightweight parser that reads text and maps key concepts to your chosen shorthand.

Output: Notebook-ready markdown or text files that compress complexity into clarity.

Example:

Input:  A penetration tester performs vulnerability assessment and reporting.
Output: 攻偵 performs 脆評 + 提

🧠 Current Lexicons

sec_terms.yaml → for cybersecurity and IT learners

art_terms.yaml → for creative process logs

legal_terms.yaml → for contracts, compliance, and documentation

Each lexicon mirrors the rhythm of its field—dense language distilled into compact, symbolic shorthand.

✨ Philosophy

Xscribe is a study companion, not a translator.
It’s about learning to see meaning at a glance, to make the abstract tactile.
Whether you’re decoding a Security+ chapter, sketching a new UI layout, or reading a technical paper in another language, Xscribe helps you keep comprehension and expression moving in tandem—brain and hand, thought and mark, data and design.
