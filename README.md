# What's Xscribe?

Xscribe (transcribe) is based on my personal shorthand that borrows kanji (Chinese characters) or glyphs without linguistic accuracy. 

Main purpose: Take the shape and meaning of the characters to reinforce a concept. 

**This shorthand system doesn't obey Japanese grammatical rules (like Subject-Object-Verb (SOV) agreement) for sentence structure.** 

Rather, kanji serve as an anchor for semantic domains (e.g. InfoSec, perspective drawing, etc.). 

Verbs at the end of sentences in English (Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) language) may not fit within the margin of my notebook and are sometimes replaced with Japanese verbs. 

The focus is mostly on kanji replacing lengthy or dense terms. 

My goal with this project is to automate or improve how I implement shorthand into my digital notes. For example, making current event articles in Cybersecurity more memorable for future conversations or notes, simplifying my notes on music theory for faster recall, and distinguishing the nuances of synonyms I encounter during my note-taking process.

🌍 Origin

The idea grew from my background in translation and interpretation, and especially from my fascination with simultaneous interpreting—that mental dance of keeping the brain’s processor and the hand’s motion perfectly in sync.

Writing shorthand became a way to train that same split-second coordination: decoding complex ideas while encoding them back into symbols that fit the page, the moment, and my memory.

Xscribe’s goal is to bring that experience into a digital space—helping learners, creators, and technologists translate dense material into shorthand-friendly, visually meaningful notes.

🧩 How It Works

Lexicon Files (YAML): Each domain (Security+, IT, Art, Legal, etc.) has its own dictionary of terms and their shorthand equivalents.

Core Engine: A lightweight parser that reads text and maps key concepts to your chosen shorthand.

Output: Notebook-ready markdown or text files that compress complexity into clarity.

Example:

Input:  A penetration tester performs vulnerability assessment and reporting.
Output: 攻偵 performs 脆評 + 提

*This is actually an instance where I'd push back on what AI or Language Model may suggest for a shorthand kanji. I prefer kanji with fewer strokes. 弱 is easier to write than 脆. In fact, the more "stick-like" the better! 

🧠 Current Lexicons

sec_terms.yaml → for cybersecurity and IT learners

art_terms.yaml → for creative process logs

legal_terms.yaml → for contracts, compliance, and documentation

Each lexicon mirrors the rhythm of its field—dense language distilled into compact, symbolic shorthand.

✨ Philosophy

Xscribe is a study companion, not a translator.

It’s about learning to see meaning at a glance, to make the abstract tactile.

Whether you’re decoding a Security+ chapter, sketching a new UI layout, or reading a technical paper in another language, Xscribe helps you keep comprehension and expression moving in tandem—brain and hand, thought and mark, data and design.
