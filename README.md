# xscribe
Xscribe is a personal, multilingual shorthand framework born from the overlap between language learning, technical study, and creative flow. It began as handwritten notes—kanji symbols, abbreviations, and visual cues—scribbled in the margins of notebooks. Over time, those symbols formed a compact visual language I am dedicated to streamlining.
